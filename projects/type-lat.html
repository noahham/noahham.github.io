                <h2>TUI Typing Test</h2>
                <p class="stack"><i>Golang, Bubbletea, SSH</i></p>
                <p>A terminal-based typing test available to everyone through SSH.</p>
                <p>I found <code>ssh terminal.shop</code> and thought it was really cool so I wanted to learn how they made it. I decided to make a typing test like MonkeyType that was available through SSH and not HTML.</p>
                <p>Before this project, most of my programming has been with Python. I was pretty hesitant to approach Golang and Bubbletea but it turned out a lot more simple that I initially though it would be.</p>
                <p>If you want to try the test out yourself, just type <code>ssh test@type.lat</code> into your terminal.</p>
