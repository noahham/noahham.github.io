                <p>A friendly user interface to help you beat the daily Wordle.</p>
                <p>This was one of the very first programming projects that I made. During quarantine, a lot of people found themselves obsessed with Wordle. Some were amazing at it, and others: not so much.</p>
                <p>This is a simple tool to help those people out, without just giving away the answer.</p>
