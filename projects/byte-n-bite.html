                <p>An offline, AI powered recipe generating and lookup app.</p>
                <p>Most people only really cycle between the same recipes. Coming home after a long day, it's always nice to cook something comfortable and familiar. This app stores recipes in a local database that can be displayed while offline.</p>
                <p>The search algorithm can filter pretty much anything. Whether you know the recipe you want to make or you just have a list of ingredients, you can just type in the search box.</p>
                <p>If you're in the mood for something new, you can also use the integrated OpenAI API to generate a new recipe given any (and I really mean ANY) ingredients that you have on hand.</p>
