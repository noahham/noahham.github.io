                <h3>Goal & Constraints</h3>
                <p>Create a logo and color scheme that align with both Oregon’s natural environment and the technological identity of hackathons and the University of Oregon.</p>

                <h3>Initial Direction & Feedback</h3>
                <p>Being part of a larger team that tackled the rebrand, I was primarily responsible for a new color scheme. Knowing the logo would likely be technology-based, I wanted the color scheme to look like Oregon. After looking around on and off campus and taking photos of UO and its surrounding area, I ran the images through a Python algorithm that I wrote to output samples of their most common hues.</p>
                <p>Our creative director appreciated the approach but suggested opting for a more unified color scheme rather than direct samples.</p>

                <h3>Final Product</h3>
                <p>By taking inspiration from the samples, we constructed a unified palette that was much more balanced than the raw originals. The new color scheme quickly became a pivotal part of the rebrand and grounded the organization to its Oregonian roots.</p>
