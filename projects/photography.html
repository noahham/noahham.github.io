                <p>A styled portfolio site that looks like it sells something but really does nothing.</p>
                <p>I've always looked at other photographer's portfolio's and wondered what it would look like if I made my own. After taking a class about HTML and CSS, I finally decided to.</p>
                <p>During this project, I started playing around with sticky positioned elements and this was also the first time I used the body display: flex and flex-direction: column to center all of the sections within the site. This was honestly the first successful site I've made.</p>
